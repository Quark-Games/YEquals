# Credits
This grapher is created by QuarkGame in 2018.
The grapher has less functionality than Desmos or Grapher on Mac.
"However, it is completed with minimalist design and simple algorithms."

# Tips
* Screenshot is saved with name "screenshot.jpg" on Desktop
* Power of numbers, usually shown as '^', is automatically converted to '\*\*'. Holding Tab bar to find out the converted raw python expression
* You can use all the functions in python math module, such as 'tan()'

  [Python Math module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

* instead of using 'a\*\*b', try to use 'sqrt()' if b = 1/2, or pow(a, b) to avoid false calculation
