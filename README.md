Welcome to the Function Simulator!

***

# Credits
This function simulator is created by the QuarkGame organisation in 2018.
The functionality is lessen than Desmos or Grapher on Mac.
However, it is completed with minimalist design and simple algorithms.

# Tips
* Screenshot is saved with name "screenshot.jpg" on Desktop
* Power of numbers, usually shown as ^, is automatically converted to ^
* You can use all the functions in python math module, such as tan()

  [Python Math module] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
  
* instead of using a**b, try to use sqrt() if b = 1/2, or pow(a, b) to avoid Python false calculation
