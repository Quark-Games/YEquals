Welcome to the Function Simulator!

***

# Credits
This function simulator is created by the QuarkGame organisation in 2018.
The grapher has less functionality than Desmos or Grapher on Mac.
However, it is completed with minimalist design and simple algorithms.

# Tips
* Screenshot is saved with name "screenshot.jpg" on Desktop
* Power of numbers, usually shown as ^, is automatically converted to \*\*. Holding to Tab bar to find out the converted raw python expression
* You can use all the functions in python math module, such as tan()

  [Python Math module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

* instead of using a\*\*b, try to use sqrt() if b = 1/2, or pow(a, b) to avoid false calculation
